- The key ability of a human programmer is not to code but to bridge the mental model of the user and the system image. It requires _Empathy_, _Creativity_ and _Rationality_

# Practices That Enable Design In Programming

- Give opportunities for Developers to _Enter the Flow State_
  - Watch Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi [TED talk about the Flow](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness)
- Protect the Developers time slots
  - Read Paul Graham [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

Fine, but how do you _practically_:

- Develop a shared understanding of the Domain between the Business and the Tech?
- Reflect _directly_ in the code without loss of knowledge?
- Evolve your mental models and architecture around them?

# Domain-Driven Design (AKA DDD)

![w:800px center](DDD-books.jpg)

- My personal definition: _Design Thinking applied to Software Architecture_

---

# When Use DDD?

## Quick History

- Created in 2003 but initial slow adoption, mostly in Enterprise software.
- Rise of distributed architecture and micro-services makes the methodoloy much more relevant
- Officially recommended in the [MS .Net micro-services architecture guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/)

## Use Cases

- Great for products (long-term evolution) with complex domains
- DDD enables _Evolutionary Architecture_ via iterative Design
- Overkill for applications with a simple domain

---

# Incremental vs Iterative Design

![center](patton-incrementing-mona-lisa.jpg)
![center](patton-iterating-mona-lisa.jpg)

- DDD works very well with Agile (actually makes it better)

---

# Reality is A Mix of Iterative/Design

![center](iterative-incremental-mona-lisa.png)

---

# 2. DDD Key Concepts

## Strategic Patterns - Business + Socio-Technical

- Bounded Context
- Ubiquitous Language
- Core Domain Chart
- Context Map

## Tactical Patterns - Code Level

- Onion Architecture
- CRUD vs CQRS
- Domain Events

---

# Strategic Business Challenge = Domain

![w:600px center](domains.png)

- Domains = Problem space
- Separate into Sub-Domains = Core vs non-Core

---

# Bounded Contexts

![w:650px center](bounded-context.png)

- Bounded Context = Logical boundary between Models (Solution space)
- Remember the _one database per micro-service_ best practice?

---

# Sounds Familiar?

![w:800px center](what-talking-about.png)

---

# Ubiquitous Language

![w:800px center](ubiquitous-language.png)

- Fancy name for _Domain Language_

---

# Ubiquitous Language is a Pillar of DDD

- SMEs are the source
- Key to build a shared understanding of the Domain between the many stakeholders
- Glossary is a must-maintain
- Never underestimate the power of the words: Any word ambiguity can reveal profound misunderstandings between the stakeholders
- Always stick to the UL, including in the code!

---

# Core Domain Charts

## How to prioritize the Sub-Domains

- Core Domain: Heart of the solution, strong differentaition
- Supporting domain: Vital for ops of Core Domain but not strategic
- Generic: Needed functionality but not critical and commotditized

## How to couple the Bounded Contexts

- Team assignment is the first draft of architecture
- Distributed teams: Scope of responsibility, size, types of relationships
- _Inverse Conway Manoeuver_: Make implicitly hidden organization process visible + identify flow of bad models + establish decentralized governance model

# Context Maps

<div class="ldiv">

- Visualize the sociotechical architecture
- Align the teams and systems with the Context Boundaries

# Tactical Patterns - Code Level

- How to structure the code so that the architecture and model can evolve seamlessly
- Sometimes the most confusing part of DDD for beginners: Entities, Value Objects, Root Aggregates, etc...
- Recent trend in testing: [Architecture resting](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/automation-testing-architecture/) (check components complexity and boundaries)
- We'll focus on the _high level_ Tactical Patterns

---

# Hexagonal / Onion Architecture Benefits

- Strong decoupling between the technology stacks/systems and the Business Logic of the Application (= Domain Model)
- Better maintainability and evolution of the architecture
- Isolation of the Domain Model:
  - Makes the Model more explicit: continutation of the shared understanding between the Business and Developers
  - Faster to test so more robust

# CRUD vs CQRS

## Create / Read / Update / Delete

- Relational databases are an impressive mature technology but they have their pros/cons in terms of data modeling
- We have all been brainwashed by Create / Read / Update / Delete (CRUD)
- CRUD doesn't map with the Domain Actions:
  - Do you ever _Delete_ a financial record?
  - What does _Update_ an order mean? Review it? Add items? etc...
- Similar semantic limitations with the HTTP verbs used by REST
- Model and performance dilemma between Write (transactions) vs Read (joins)

---

# Command Query Responsibility Segregation

![w:800px center](cqrs.png)

---

# CQRS Benefits

- More overhead than CRUD but enables persistence of Domain
- Actions map with the Domain Ubiquitous Language
- Not limited to 1 database or data model anymore. Ex.: 1 DB for Ops and 1 DB for reporting
- Command/Query Bus decouples the Application with the other components
- Enables Event Sourcing (we'll see another time)

---

# Domain Events

![w:800px center](domain-events.png)

- DDD first class citizens = Output of Domain Command
- Enable Application messaging via Publish/Subscribe, etc
- Enable very fine-grained Application Behavioural Analytics without additional work

---

# 3 Application of DDD in the Projects

- Where to Start?
- Event Storming Workshops: From big picture to process modeling and software design
- Core Domain Patterns: Team organization and Business Models
- Context Mapping: Team and system relationships
- Business-Driven Development: Testable Business examples
- Events-Driven Architecture

---

# Where to Start?

![w:800px center](ddd-starter-modelling-process.jpg)

- From https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process

---

# Event Storming Workshops

- Rising usage in the DDD community. Not just the new hype of post-it workshop lovers
- Gather all the stakeholders (Sales, Finance, Ops, Dev, etc) to
  - Do hands-on modeling out loud
  - Create empathy and shared understanding
  - Find the boundaries between the Sub-Domains
  - Align on the strategic choices
- Why Events:
  - Tangible business fact that does not assume prior model or architecture
  - Directly reusable by DDD

# How Does Event Storming Look Like?

![w:1200px center](event-storming1.jpg)

- Infinite horizontal space liberates the people mental maps and collaboration

# Events-Driven Architecture

- Big topic for another time! But Domain Events enable natively sophisticated architecture patterns used by [Micro-Services](https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html), susch as [Event Sourcing](https://eventstore.com/blog/what-is-event-sourcing/)
